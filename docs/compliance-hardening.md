# Compliance Hardening & Risk-Accepted Exceptions

Status of the portal `/compliance` page (trivy-operator ClusterComplianceReport:
CIS 1.23, NSA 1.0, PSS baseline/restricted). Records what was hardened, and which
failing controls are **accepted risk** (fixing them would break the platform or
undo a deliberate design choice) vs. **deferred** (safe but not yet done).

## Applied hardening (2026-07-08)

| Area | Change | Controls fixed |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Control-plane profiling | `--profiling=false` on apiserver / controller-manager / scheduler (kubeadm `extraArgs` in `scripts/cluster/02-init-cluster.sh` + live static-pod patch on all 3 masters) | CIS 1.2.18, 1.4.1 (verified PASS) |
| Portal / Valkey workloads | `securityContext`: `runAsNonRoot`, drop ALL caps, `allowPrivilegeEscalation:false`, `seccompProfile:RuntimeDefault` (`gitops/charts/narwhal-platform/templates/narwhal-portal-k8s.yaml`) | Removed all critical/high config-audit findings for these two workloads (PSS 5.2.x / 5.7.2 contributions) |
| Secret encryption at rest | `--encryption-provider-config` (aescbc) on all 3 apiservers; all 105 existing Secrets rewritten/encrypted; key generated once, shared across masters. Source: `02-init-cluster.sh` (generate+write on master-1) + `02-join-control-plane.sh` (fetch same key). | CIS 1.2.30 (verified PASS; etcd raw shows `k8s:enc:aescbc:v1:key1:`) |
| API audit logging | `--audit-policy-file` + `--audit-log-path/maxage=30/maxbackup=10/maxsize=100` on all 3 apiservers; balanced policy (secrets/rbac at Metadata, health/reads dropped). | CIS 1.2.19/1.2.20/1.2.21/1.2.22 (verified PASS; audit.log writing) |
| Node file permissions | `chmod 600` kubelet service unit + config.yaml + k8s CA + static-pod manifests on all nodes (`scripts/cluster/harden-node-files.sh`). | CIS 4.1.1, 4.1.7, 4.1.9 (verified PASS) |

Result: CIS 72% → 84%+, NSA 44% → 59%+. Control-plane flag controls (profiling, audit, encryption) all PASS.

## Risk-accepted exceptions (do NOT "fix")

These failing controls are expected for this IDP platform. Changing them breaks
functionality or reverses an intentional trade-off.

1. **`--bind-address` = 0.0.0.0 on controller-manager / scheduler** (CIS 1.3.7, 1.4.2 —
   1.4.2 is CRITICAL). Deliberately set so Prometheus (off the control-plane node) can
   scrape `/metrics`. On the private `192.168.56.0/24` lab network this is not an
   exposure. Reverting to 127.0.0.1 blinds monitoring. See `02-init-cluster.sh`.
2. **Privileged / hostPath / hostNetwork / NET_RAW / root workloads** (CIS 5.2.2/5.2.3/
   5.2.5/5.2.6/5.2.7/5.2.8/5.2.10/5.2.12/5.2.13, 5.7.2/5.7.3; NSA 1.0/1.1/1.2/1.4/1.5/
   1.7/1.9/1.10; PSS baseline/restricted 3/4/5). The large counts are dominated by
   **platform components that require these privileges to function**: Cilium (NET_ADMIN,
   privileged, hostNetwork), Istio ambient (ztunnel/istio-cni), trivy node-collector
   (hostPath to read node files), CSI/NFS, kube-system system pods. These cannot be
   hardened without breaking CNI / mesh / storage / scanning.
3. **`kube-system` used by platform** (NSA 1.12) — the platform legitimately runs there.
4. **Broad RBAC / secret access / wildcards** (CIS 5.1.2, 5.1.3, 5.1.6) — required by
   operators (ArgoCD, Keycloak Operator, cert-manager, etc.).

## Deferred (safe, not yet done)

Worthwhile but out of the "quick safe win" scope; each needs care and control-plane
restarts on all 3 masters:

- **Persist node file perms across reinstall**: `harden-node-files.sh` is applied live
  but kubeadm/kubelet recreate these files at default perms on a fresh install. Wire the
  script into the provisioning path (post-join, per node) after clean-install validation,
  or run it manually post-install.
- **CIS 1.1.9 (CNI file perms) & 1.1.12 (etcd dir ownership)**: on-disk state is already
  correct (CNI files are 600; `/var/lib/etcd` is `etcd:etcd` recursively) but the trivy
  **node-collector can't verify them** from its container context (can't map the host
  `etcd` user; CNI dir 0700 not traversable by the scanner) — a scanner limitation, not a
  real gap. Treated as risk-accepted.
- **`--anonymous-auth=false`**, `EventRateLimit`, `--kubelet-certificate-authority` —
  apiserver hardening (test probes first).
- Portal/Valkey `readOnlyRootFilesystem` (CIS 5.7.3 / KSV014) — Next.js writes cache/tmp
  at runtime; needs writable `emptyDir` mounts before enabling.

## How the page is fed

trivy-operator scanners must be enabled (`gitops/charts/narwhal-apps/templates/trivy-operator.yaml`):
`configAuditScannerEnabled`, `rbacAssessmentScannerEnabled`, `infraAssessmentScannerEnabled`,
`clusterComplianceEnabled` = true, and `compliance.reportType: all` (summary yields no
per-control detail). Reports regenerate on the `0 */6 * * *` cron; to force one, briefly
patch a report's `spec.cron` to `* * * * *`.
